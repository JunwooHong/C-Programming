            /*Task:

            Imagine you're building a simple game where players can create characters. Each character needs to have a name, a health value, and an attack power.

            Create a struct called `Character` to represent a character in your game.

            Here are some hints to help you:

            * The `Character` struct should have three members: `name` (string), `health` (int), and `attackPower` (int).
            * Declare the struct.
            * Initialize a `Character` object with sample values for name, health, and attack power.
            * Print the character's information to the console.

            Let me know when you've completed the task, and I'll be happy to review your code! */
